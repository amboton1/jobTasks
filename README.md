# jobTasks

Here you can find tasks that candidates usually solve for the purpose of coding evaluation.

## How To Solve  

* First read the below description of each task.
* Choose task or tasks that best suits your expertise.
* Read carefully what is expected to be done, especially the "Definition Of Done" and "You Will Fail" part
* Solve as many as you like and on whichever level/tech you like
* Submit by creating a Pull Request or simply zip it and send to our email

## What will be assessed  

In development there is no one single solution, so, we will be looking into the approach you've taken.  
Also, we will be looking into coding best practices, coding style, readability, etc... Make it clean and beautiful!  
Please, do not just copy/paste from StackOverflow, add the source from where you took a chunk/snippet of code. There is no shame in doing this, but we would like to assess your coding skills, not copy/pasting skills.  

** It doesn't matter how many tasks you solve, what matters is how you solve them! **
